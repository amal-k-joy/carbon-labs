## Overview

The "First Time Orientation" pattern is built using  [InterstitialScreen component](https://ibm-products.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/experimental-onboarding-interstitialscreen--docs&globals=theme:white;viewport:basic) component from `@carbon/ibm-products`

  productâ€™s primary value.The pattern consist of a Welcome interstitial and Personalization interstitial. You can fine more details in our [website](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/patterns/onboarding-flows/orientation/)
